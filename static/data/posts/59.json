This project was a hands-on exploration of Android UI components, from buttons and text views to dynamic layout handling. While the gameplay is simple — roll dice, flip tiles, and try to shut the box — the challenge lay in translating tactile mechanics into a smooth digital experience. It was a great exercise in managing state, user input, and visual feedback, all within the constraints of a mobile interface."
